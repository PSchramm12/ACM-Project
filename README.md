# ACM-Project

## Project Description

### What could your project focus on? (Text Analysis Slidedeck)

1. Data Source: What kind of texts do you want to analyse? → Examples: social media posts,
news articles, scientific abstracts, forum discussions, product reviews, political speeches,
parliamentary transcripts, NGO reports, song lyrics, Subreddits, YouTube comments.
2. Relevance: Why is your research question socially, politically, or scientifically meaningful?
3. Methods: Which techniques from today’s session could be applied? → Examples:
tokenization, frequency analysis, POS tagging, NER, sentiment analysis, topic modeling.
4. Feasibility: Where will the data come from? How large might the dataset be, and how
easy is it to process?
5. Expected Insights: What patterns, themes, moods, networks, or dynamics could your
analysis reveal?

### Guidance for your projects (Text Analysis II Slidedeck)

1. Text Representation Plan: Describe how you will transform your raw text into a numerical representation.
2. Topic Exploration Strategy: Explain whether and how topic mining could support your analysis.
3. Analytical Pipeline Draft: Create a short outline (bullet points or a small flowchart) of your planned analytical workflow.
4. Feasibility Check: Reflect briefly on practical constraints, for example: Do you expect enough data for meaningful topic modeling?
5. Expected Topic-Based Insights: Describe what you hope to uncover using topic modeling or text representation (hypothesis).

### Guiding Questions for your Project (Network Analysis Slidedeck)
- What are the nodes in your project? → Individuals, organizations, documents, users, items, terms, events?
- What defines an edge between two nodes? → Interaction, co-occurrence, communication, similarity, collaboration?
- Which network metrics are meaningful for your question? → Degree, clustering, distance,
connectivity, centrality?
- Are there groups or communities you expect to find? → What would they represent
substantively?
- How does network structure support or challenge your hypothesis? → Does the observed structure match theoretical expectations?
- What are the limitations of your network construction? → Missing data, modeling choices,
aggregation decisions?
